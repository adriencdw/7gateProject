This project is about development of smoke detection algorithms in case of forest fires.

Our main problem statement is learning CNN model for object detection using different existing object detection models.

Step 1: Data gathering and collection:

We have gathered data available online at below location.

https://sintecsys-omdena.s3.amazonaws.com/images3.zip

Dataset have almost 16.5K images (~8k masked and ~8k original images).

Step 2: Exploration of data:

Masked images has been already created. Model needs to be trained on existing masked images and start predicting.

Size of images is: 1920 X 1080

Step 3: Applying Image recognition and Object detection models.

Iteration 1:
I have created simple image recognition model and tried to train with simple CNN model

Feedback on the model on instructors:
